Code for the NLP project for the course "Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing" at ENSAE:
* Eric Vong
* Raphael Thabut

## Useful ressources 

* We recommend using python 3.7.0 and conda to build the environment
* The repository is largely inspired by the paper Detection of Adversarial Examples in Text Classification: Benchmark and Baseline via Robust Density Estimation and their repo accessible [here](https://github.com/bangawayoo/adversarial-examples-in-text-classification)
* Our overleaf report is available [here]
* The repository of the project course is available [here](https://github.com/PierreColombo/NLP_ENSAE_2023/blob/main/project/project_2_attacks.md)
